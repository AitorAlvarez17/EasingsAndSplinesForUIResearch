# Easings and Splines for UI animations

## Description 

In videogames the UI animations have an infinity of ways to be implemented, and in this process we can implement a series of improvements in order to achieve a better finish in the animations. We call this easing and we use the technicality and mathematics of the splines to achieve them.

To learn more about this specific field enter this Repository's **[page](https://aitoralvarez17.github.io/EasingsAndSplinesForUIResearch/)**  and in the [presentation](https://github.com/AitorAlvarez17/EasingsAndSplinesForUIResearch/blob/master/docs/EasingAndSplinesForUIAnimations.pdf).

In this repository you can a find 2 visual studio solutions called **[handout](https://github.com/AitorAlvarez17/EasingsAndSplinesForUIResearch/tree/master/handout)** and **[solution](https://github.com/AitorAlvarez17/EasingsAndSplinesForUIResearch/tree/master/solution)** with the some examples of the implementation of this techniques both in a game's camera movement and in a sample UI element.
